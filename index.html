    <p>"Hello my name is Saavya Saxena. And I have made this website in visual studios. Let me tell you how I made it. First go to this link - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win then after it has finished downloading the installer you can run the
        installer and it will download the actual application for you. After that you can simply make a new folder, right click and select open with code, make an index.html and start coding" </p>
    <p> Right now if you right click this webpage and click on inspect and go to console you might see a lot of numbers a letters that I have put there this can be done by using the console.log function. The JavaScript console log function is mainly used
        for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print the output to the console.</p>
